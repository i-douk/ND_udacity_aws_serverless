## Code explanation

This code is an AWS Lambda function that serves as a custom authorizer for an API Gateway. The function is responsible for authenticating and authorizing incoming requests to the API.
It uses the jsonwebtoken package to verify the signature of a JWT token passed in the authorization header of the incoming request. It uses the 'source-map-support/register' package to enable source maps for the project.
It also uses the Axios package to make an HTTP request to the Auth0 JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) endpoint to download a certificate that is used to verify the JWT token signature.
It checks if the incoming request has an authorization header and if it starts with 'bearer '. Then it splits the header to extract the token and pass it to the verifyToken function.
The verifyToken function decodes the JWT token and gets the signing key from the JWKS that matches the kid in the header of the JWT. It then verifies the signature of the JWT using the signing key.
If the token is verified successfully, the function returns an object that allows the request and indicates the authenticated user's principalId. If the token is not verified, the function denies the request.

The serverless.yml file is used to define the configuration for a Serverless Framework project. It is used to define the AWS resources that are needed for the project such as Lambda functions, API Gateway, and more.
It could be used to define the triggers that invoke the Lambda function, such as an API Gateway trigger, and to configure the function's environment variables, IAM permissions, and other settings.
It could also be used to define other resources such as S3 buckets, DynamoDB tables, etc.
